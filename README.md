# Nextjs Amplify Demo project

I just wanted to understand how different phases of amplify commands would make effects on folder structure of the project.

Different amplify commands we will use during the process are:

<br>
<b> Configure amplify-cli with user profile, region and access Id's and secure keys </b>
<br>
```sh
$ amplify configure
```
the above command would not impact any folder structure of the project. this would have some impact on the credentials file in user profiles.

we are setting up an extra set of commands to configure our project with tailwind css.
